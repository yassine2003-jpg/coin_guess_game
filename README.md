# Coin Guess Game ðŸª™

A simple Python game where you guess the result of a coin toss.

## How it Works

- You choose either `head` or `tail`
- The computer flips the coin using one of two methods:
  - `random.random()`
  - `random.randint()`
- If you guess correctly, you win!

## Example

```bash
Welcome to the Coin Guessing Game!
Choose a method to toss the coin:
1 - Use random.random()
2 - Use random.randint()
Enter 1 or 2: 1
Please choose 'head' or 'tail': head
ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You guessed right. The result is head.
